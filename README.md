# Bank REST API

A RESTful API for a banking system built with Python, Flask, and Flask-Smorest. This application provides endpoints for user management (customers) and loan processing, including loan applications, payments, and ledger tracking. It features JWT-based authentication and automatically generated OpenAPI (Swagger) documentation.

## Features

*   **User Authentication**: Secure user registration, login, and logout using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
*   **Loan Management**:
    *   Apply for a new loan.
    *   Make payments towards a loan (including lump-sum payments).
    *   View all loans associated with a customer.
    *   Get a detailed loan ledger with a history of all payments.
*   **Automatic API Documentation**: Interactive Swagger UI for exploring and testing API endpoints, generated by Flask-Smorest.
*   **Database Migrations**: Managed database schema changes using Flask-Migrate.
*   **CORS Support**: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing enabled for frontend integration.

## Technology Stack

*   **Language**: Python 3.12
*   **Framework**: Flask, Flask-Smorest
*   **Database ORM**: Flask-SQLAlchemy
*   **Database Migrations**: Flask-Migrate
*   **Authentication**: Flask-JWT-Extended
*   **Environment Variables**: python-dotenv
*   **CORS**: Flask-Cors

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
*   Python 3.12 or higher
*   `pip` (Python package installer)
*   A PostgreSQL database (or you can modify the `DB_URL` for another database).

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/chiragsd94/bank_rest_api.git
    cd bank_rest_api
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    *   **macOS / Linux:**
        ```bash
        python3 -m venv .venv
        source .venv/bin/activate
        ```
    *   **Windows:**
        ```bash
        python -m venv .venv
        .venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    *(Ensure you have a `requirements.txt` file in your project root)*
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the project root. You can copy the `.env.example` if one exists, or create a new file.
    ```bash
    # Example: cp .env.example .env
    ```
    Add your configuration to the `.env` file:
    ```ini
    # Example for PostgreSQL
    DB_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/bank_db"
    
    # A strong, secret key for JWT
    JWT_SECRET_KEY="your-super-secret-key"
    ```

5.  **Database Migration:**
    Initialize the database and apply the migrations:
    ```bash
    flask db init  # Only if you don't have a 'migrations' folder
    flask db migrate -m "Initial migration"
    flask db upgrade
    ```

## Usage

To run the development server:

```bash
flask run
```
